          This is a tribute page to Mike Tyson's boxing career. Tyson is
          regarded as one of the most ferocious boxers in history

          <li>
            As an amateur, Tyson won gold medals at the 1981 and 1982 Junior
            Olympic Games, defeating Joe Cortez in 1981 and beating Kelton Brown
          </li>
          <li>
            Tyson made his professional debut as an 18-year-old on March 6,
            1985, in Albany, New York. He defeated Hector Mercedes via
            first-round TKO
          </li>
          <li>
            Tyson became the Undisputed Heavyweight Champion as the culmination
            of the heavyweight unification series, by unifying his WBA and WBC,
            with Tony Tucker's IBF belt. The Ring magazine later recognized him
            as champion on June 27, 1988.
